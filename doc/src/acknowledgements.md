Many of ideas for this library are based on these other libraries:

* [Boost.Egg](http://p-stade.sourceforge.net/boost/libs/egg/doc/html/index.html): A very powerful library for function objects in C++98.
* [Boost.Hana](https://github.com/ldionne/hana): A metaprogramming library with many functional constructs
